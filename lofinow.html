        In the current day, lo-fi has been trending downwards. Its popularity peaked in 2020, during the COVID-19 era, but I would not say its heading towards irrelevancy.
        However, there have been concerns among listeners for years regarding the state of the lo-fi sphere. Due to the increase in popularity in the early 2020's, new tracks
        were being produced at a rate the genre has never seen before. More people had more time to themselves, and now started involving themseles in a topic they normally wouldn't.
        It's not necessarily a bad thing, but with how minimalist the style can be, many regular listeners in the current year see an oversaturation and overall stagnation of Lo-fi music
        as a whole. With how long its been around, there's little room for experientation left. Many tracks can sound very similar and ultimately feel uninspired, which is a 
        little ironic considering the early days of this style of music. It was a movement to bring authenticity and genuineness. Once there was a drive for internet 
        popularity, the common features of lo-fi changed. There are fewer pieces featuring sampling, and more emphasize feelings of surrealism and "spacing out." For many, 
        it truly became "beats to sleep/relax/study to." Its primary characteristics make it easy to replicate. A situation with a low bar for entry, and a high bar to stand out.

        The popularity of lo-fi also makes it a massive target for something extremely detrimental to it: artifical intelligence. AI has many uses around the world,
        and can prove to be beneficial for society in many ways. Personally, however, I'm of the belief that it has little to no space in any creative department. On YouTube and
        Spotify, many published tracks and videos have been determined to be AI-generated. These heavily contribute to the feelings of oversaturation and blandness people
        experience with lo-fi. With how simple many tracks can be, it's very easy for a machine to replicate it and produce them by the dozen, with both individuals and companies compiling them into
        hour-long videos on YouTube and publishing them on services like Spotify. There are still real artists trying to create music in this style, but it can be difficult to determine
        if a specific track or playlist is from one of them or not.

        <p class="lofinow">Methods to detect if lo-fi music is from an artist or an "artist":</p>
        <ul class="lofinow">
            <li>Frequency of uploads. If they're uploading at rates that seem impossible, it's likely that AI is doing most of the work.</li>
            <li>Take a look at any artwork/imagery associated with the music. Does it appear to be AI-generated? If it does, there's a high chance the music is too.</li>
            <li>Look them up! Check who the music is credited to and if they have a site to see their work, or if there's even a name associated with each track (this applies to playlists more). 
                Some snooping around can lead to dead ends, which is a dead giveaway. You can also look around on social media, there's a chance 
                someone else has already found the answer.
