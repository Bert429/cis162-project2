              In the early 1990’s, alternative rock was becoming prominent in pop culture. 
              Lo-fi was becoming a sort of movement within the music world with a focus on “authenticity” in music. 
              Once the New York Times featured it in their headlines in 1993, lo-fi started becoming mainstream. However, it didn’t 
              really stick as a genre of its own until later. The term wasn’t used consistently, with every journalist and artist 
              discussing the topic seemingly having a unique interpretation of what it meant for music to be “lo-fi.” By the mid-90’s, 
              there were attempts to solidify what lo-fi is, and it proved to shape the culture around it, even in the present day. Richie 
              Unterberger’s book, Unknown Legends of Rock ‘n’ Roll, and Rolling Stone magazine featuring a top 10 for lo-fi artists 
              in their Alt-Rock-a-Rama helped people agree on what it is. Despite this, lo-fi lost its unique relevance, not helped with music 
              sampling controversies that were prominent in the genre. Soon, it was just considered part of the indie music sphere all 
              through the late 90’s and 2000’s.

              With technology rapidly advancing, the differences between music creations in a professional setting and at home became 
              smaller. Many artists pursuing the lo-fi aesthetic began using older equipment to achieve the same effects. In the 2000's, 
              there began a shift of focus, where some artists leaned further into the appeal of nostalgia and childhood memories. This, along with
              new cult followings of artists such as Nujabes and J Dilla cemented lo-fi as a subgenre of music, something that stands on its own.

              With the 2010's, the internet rapidly became a part of everyday life, and has given people access to more information 
              than they could ever need. Media sharing websites such as YouTube, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, and Spotify gained popularity
              and became musical hubs for anyone who wanted to listen to music. Similar to other genres, lo-fi boomed in popularity
              as a result of this. In the late 2010's, many YouTube channels began creating livestreams and playlists on YouTube
              that will play lo-fi music non-stop. These tracks were tagged with the terms "lo-fi hip hop" or "chillhop." With its 
              notable lack of vocals, people realized it was easy to listen to while focusing on studying or homework. This has 
              resulted in a strong connection between lo-fi playlists and phrases such as "beats to sleep/relax/study to."
